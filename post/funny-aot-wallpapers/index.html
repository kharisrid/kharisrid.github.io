-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=aot-wallpaper---nawpic-1>AOT Wallpaper - NawPic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#aot-wallpaper---nawpic-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.nawpic.com/media/2020/aot-nawpic-33.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0VnUhxB7lXXp94f7TxzrOwHaET&pid=15.1"' alt="AOT Wallpaper - NawPic"><p><em>Source: nawpic.com</em></p><blockquote><p>aot levi ackerman eren legion scouting mikasa liftng fondos 4k shingeki kyojin wallpapertip saves nawpic hintergrundbild pixiv 1080 gbodhi wallpapersden.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
