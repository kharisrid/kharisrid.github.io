While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=arms-poses-by-puiizy-on-deviantart>Arms (Poses) By Puiizy On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#arms-poses-by-puiizy-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://img11.deviantart.net/4375/i/2017/145/5/8/arms__poses__by_puiizy-dbadqef.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.csHPt_nRPwoMkCYe-RIO-QHaEE&pid=15.1"' alt="Arms (Poses) by Puiizy on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: puiizy.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Different ways to style your wallpaper:
